    {
        "input": "How can I configure a single Azure peering VLAN?",
        "output": "You can configure the VXC so that Megaport removes the Q-in-Q requirement by remapping one of the B-End VLAN IDs for Private Peering or Microsoft Peering to the customer Megaport-facing VLAN.

    },
    {
        "input": "What is the drawback of untagging the VXC?",
        "output": "By configuring the VXC as untagged, the S-Tag is automatically removed. However, this limits the port to a single VXC connection, meaning you can only configure a single B-End target. It also means that your port will receive all inner VLAN tags as single/dot1q tagged."

        "input": "How does deploying a Megaport Cloud Router help with Q-in-Q?",
        "output": "By deploying a Megaport Cloud Router (MCR), you can automate the handling of Q-in-Q requirements for one or both peering types. However, this comes with additional cost for the MCR and an additional VXC to the MCR."

        "input": "What happens with Q-in-Q when connecting to Microsoft ExpressRoute?",
        "output": "When connecting to Microsoft ExpressRoute, the VXCs may contain one or two inner VLAN tags (C-Tags). These inner tags are configured in the Microsoft Azure console and are required for the ExpressRoute connection. Network equipment that supports Q-in-Q can access these inner tags by stripping the outer VLAN tag (S-Tag)."
    },
    {
        "input": "Can I use more than one peering type with the single Azure peering VLAN configuration?",
        "output": "No, with the single Azure peering VLAN configuration, only one peering type (private or Microsoft) is supported per VXC. If you need to use both peering types, you will need to configure two separate VXCs."
    },
    {
        "input": "How does configuring the VXC as untagged affect the VLAN tags?",
        "output": "By configuring the VXC as untagged, the outer VLAN (S-Tag) is removed, and the inner VLAN tags (C-Tags) are presented to the customer Megaport. This allows for the transparent transfer of the inner VLAN tags without the need for Q-in-Q settings on the customer device."

The MCR manages the S-Tags (outer tags) and transparently carries the C-Tags, allowing for efficient and flexible network connections."
    },
    {
        "input": "Is it possible to have multiple Azure VXCs on an MCR with the same VLAN tags?",
        "output": "Yes, if you have multiple Azure VXCs on an MCR, you can populate the same VLAN tags for private peering and public peering. The MCR will manage the Q-in-Q tunnel for each Azure VXC, and each Azure VLAN will be treated as a separate logical interface."

        "input": "What are the limitations of the Single Azure Peering VLAN option?",
        "output": "The Single Azure Peering VLAN option allows you to specify a single Azure peering VLAN for the VXC. However, it only supports one peering type (private or Microsoft) per VXC. If you need to use both peering types, you will need to configure two separate VXCs."

        "input": "Can I use different VLAN tags for primary and secondary ExpressRoute endpoints?",
        "output": "Yes, it is possible to use different VLAN tags for the primary and secondary Microsoft ExpressRoute endpoints on a given ExpressRoute circuit. This can be used to achieve zonal diversity or split the primary/secondary connections across two Megaport-enabled locations."
