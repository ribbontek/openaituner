{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does Q-in-Q work with Megaport VXCs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Megaport VXCs are point-to-point Layer 2 circuits that can be configured with VLAN tags. With Q-in-Q, the customer traffic VLAN tags (C-Tags) are inserted inside the service provider VLAN tags (S-Tags) provided by Megaport.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some alternatives to Q-in-Q?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If your routers or switches don't support Q-in-Q, you can consider alternatives such as configuring a single Azure peering VLAN, untagging the VXC attached to the customer port, or deploying a Megaport Cloud Router (MCR) to handle the Q-in-Q requirements."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can I configure a single Azure peering VLAN?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can configure the VXC so that Megaport removes the Q-in-Q requirement by remapping one of the B-End VLAN IDs for Private Peering or Microsoft Peering to the customer Megaport-facing VLAN. However, with this configuration, you can only use a single Microsoft peering type per VXC."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the drawback of untagging the VXC?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "By configuring the VXC as untagged, the S-Tag is automatically removed. However, this limits the port to a single VXC connection, meaning you can only configure a single B-End target. It also means that your port will receive all inner VLAN tags as single/dot1q tagged."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does deploying a Megaport Cloud Router help with Q-in-Q?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "By deploying a Megaport Cloud Router (MCR), you can automate the handling of Q-in-Q requirements for one or both peering types.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I use more than one peering type with the single Azure peering VLAN configuration?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, with the single Azure peering VLAN configuration, only one peering type (private or Microsoft) is supported per VXC. If you need to use both peering types, you will need to configure two separate VXCs."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does configuring the VXC as untagged affect the VLAN tags?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "By configuring the VXC as untagged, the outer VLAN (S-Tag) is removed, and the inner VLAN tags (C-Tags) are presented to the customer Megaport. This allows for the transparent transfer of the inner VLAN tags without the need for Q-in-Q settings on the customer device."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Is it possible to have multiple Azure VXCs on an MCR with the same VLAN tags?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, if you have multiple Azure VXCs on an MCR, you can populate the same VLAN tags for private peering and public peering. The MCR will manage the Q-in-Q tunnel for each Azure VXC, and each Azure VLAN will be treated as a separate logical interface."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the limitations of the Single Azure Peering VLAN option?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Single Azure Peering VLAN option allows you to specify a single Azure peering VLAN for the VXC.
